obigstore: multi-dimensional DB with BigTable-like data model atop LevelDB
==========================================================================
Copyright (c) 2011 Mauricio Fernandez <mfp@acm.org>

obigstore is a database server + client library. It exposes a
multidimensional BigTable-like data model built on top of the LevelDB.
It can be used in a client/server setting or as en embedded database.

obigstore's main strengths stem from the underlying LevelDB store and the data
model built atop it:
* fast random writes
* control over the physical layout of the data, allowing good spacial locality
  and fast access to data ranges

obigstore currently includes:
* the (embeddable) database library
* a server + client library
* a friendly REPL for interactive data manipulation
* DB dump/restore tools

Requirements
------------

(Debian package names parenthesized)

* OCaml >= 3.12.0 (ocaml-nox)
* omake to build (omake)
* GCC with C++ frontend (g++)
* OCaml Batteries (libbatteries-ocaml-dev)
* Lwt (liblwt-ocaml-dev)
* oUnit for the unit tests  (libounit-ocaml-dev)
* extlib (libextlib-ocaml-dev)

Building
--------
Just 

   $ omake

should do. This will build the server, client programs and libraries.
You can run the tests with

   $ omake test

The generated executables are:

* obigstore: the DB server
* ob_repl: the REPL
* ob_dump: tool to dump a DB to a file
* ob_load: tool to load ob_dump's output into a DB
